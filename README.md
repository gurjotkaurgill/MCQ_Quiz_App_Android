Project Description: An Android application resembling a true/false quiz, implemented using Java in Android Studio. The application featured randomized question colors, customizable question count per attempt, progress tracking, optional result saving in a file, average score calculation, reset of the average score, addition of new questions, and support for Punjabi language.

Action Steps:
•	Designed and implemented a Question class incorporating Boolean answer and integer colour representation.
•	Created a robust collection structure for managing instances of the Question class.
•	Utilized frame layout within the main activity to seamlessly display questions and interactive buttons.
•	Implemented dynamic elements such as shuffled questions and varied background colours for enhanced user experience.
•	Integrated a progress bar to monitor user advancement throughout quiz attempts.
•	Provided the option for users to save their quiz results externally.
•	Leveraged Dialog fragment and interfaces to facilitate functionalities including result display, average score computation, question count adjustment, addition of questions, and reset functionality.
•	Ensured preservation of application state during device rotation using savedInstanceState and app-level variables.
•	Successfully integrated support for the Punjabi language to cater to diverse user demographics.

This project showcases proficiency in Java programming for Android development, UI/UX design considerations, data management, user interaction, and multilingual support.
